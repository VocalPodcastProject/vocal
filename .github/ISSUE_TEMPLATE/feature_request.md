<!--

Thank you so much for taking the time to request a few feature for Vocal!

A few quick reminders:

By filing an Issue, you are expected to comply with our code of conduct: https://github.com/needle-and-thread/vocal/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Please keep in mind that everyone working on Vocal is doing so in their spare time between work and other life commitments, so you may not get an immediate response. It's nothing personal, we're just busy! :)

Sponsorships or financial contributions do not automatically guarantee that your requested new feature will make it into Vocal (in fact, they don't factor into such decisions at all - although we cannot express how much we appreciate your financial help with the project). It's important that we take the time to consider all the implications of any new features and make decisions that are in the best interests of the thousands of people who use Vocal to manage their podcasts.

Please make sure you preview your issue before saving.

Thanks for helping make Vocal even better!
