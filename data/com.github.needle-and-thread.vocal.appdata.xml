        <p>Grab some hot chocolate and curl up with a nice podcast this winter
        season, it's time for a new Vocal release! This time around, enjoy
        a ton of stability and performance enhancements, full HiDPI support, 
        and other bug fixes to make your experience as enjoyable as possible.
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Added HiDPI support for all images so everything looks nice and
	        sharp no matter how fancy your display is.
	        </li>
	        <li>Fixed an issue where Vocal would not show you the time elapsed
	        or remaining in an episode immediately after relaunching the app.
	        </li>
	        <li>Reduced the animation time for switching between different
	        views so that it feels extra snappy.
	        </li>
	        <li>Gave the search results view a shave and a haircut. Two bits.
	        </li>
	        <li>Fixed a few issues where Vocal would be grouchy about
	        showing certain episode descriptions.
	        </li>
	        <li>When importing several podcasts the progress bar now stays
	        one size so you can actually judge the progress correctly.
	        </li>
	        <li>You can now drag and drop items in the play queue to rearrange
	        their order.
	        </li>
	        <li>Lots more checking to make sure that things exist so it won't
	        crash nearly as much (hopefully never).
	        </li>
	    </ul>
